# Little Calendar

A simple desktop calendar app built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ElectronJS. This project is a part of my YouTube tutorial series on building your first Electron application. 

## Tutorial video

I posted a full YouTube tutorial walking through how to build this step-by-step from scratch, so this repo provides the code along the way.

## What You’ll Learn

This tutorial series covers:
